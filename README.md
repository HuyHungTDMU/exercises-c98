* [ ] What is Blockchain?
* Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across multiple
  computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability.
* In simpler terms, it's like a digital ledger or database that keeps a record of transactions or information.
  Transactions on a blockchain are grouped into blocks, and each block is linked to the previous one, creating a chain
  of blocks - hence the name "blockchain".
* This linkage ensures that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or removed without consensus from
  the network.

* [ ] What is a wallet? What can we do with Wallet Integration?
* In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a wallet is a software program or a physical device that allows
  individuals to securely store, manage, and interact with their digital assets. These digital assets can include
  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.
* A wallet consists of two main components:
* Public Key: This is like your public address, which you can share with others so they can send you cryptocurrencies.
  It's comparable to a bank account number.
* Private Key: This is like your password or PIN. It's a secret code known only to the owner of the wallet and is used
  to access and manage the funds stored in the wallet. It's crucial to keep your private key secure and not share it
  with anyone, as it provides complete control over your digital assets.
